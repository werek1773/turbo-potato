description: Hand a frozen spec (PLAN.md or any locked plan) to OpenAI Codex to IMPLEMENT with full write access, while Claude stays the spec-writer and reviewer — the exact role-flip of /codex-review. Codex builds from the spec in a --yolo sandbox, Claude reads the full diff like a contributor PR, runs the proof test, and iterates fixes via the SAME Codex session up to MAX_FIX_ROUNDS before taking over. Human approves the diff before any commit. Use when the user says "/codex-build", "have codex build this", "codex implement the plan", "hand the plan to codex", "delegate the build to codex", or right after a plan survives /grill-me-codex, /grill-with-docs-codex, or /codex-review and they choose Codex for implementation (Act 3). Also for standalone delegation: refactors, mechanical migrations, bug fixes with a known repro, test/coverage writing — anything that reads as a work order. NOT for tiny edits (~<20 lines — delegation overhead loses), NOT for design work (if writing the spec forces decisions, that's /grill-me-codex first), NOT for reviewing existing code (/codex:review), and NOT for anything needing Claude-session tools (MCP, secrets, browser).

# Codex-Build — Codex Types, Claude Verifies

The role-flip of `/codex-review`: there, Claude builds the plan and Codex critiques read-only. Here, **Codex is the builder with write access; Claude is the spec-writer and reviewer.** Codex implements a frozen spec end-to-end; Claude judges the diff like a contributor PR, demands proof, and iterates fixes in the same Codex session. The human enters at exactly two points: kickoff and diff sign-off.

Adapted from Peter Steinberger's `codex-first` pattern (agent-scripts), rebuilt on this house's verified Codex mechanics.

**Spec quality decides success.** Codex starts with zero session context — everything it needs must be in the prompt. A plan that survived `/grill-me-codex` or `/codex-review` already is a frozen spec; that's the ideal input.

## Prerequisites (verify once, fast)

- `codex --version` ≥ 0.130 (older CLIs error on the default `gpt-5.5` model).
- Codex authenticated (prior `codex login`; ChatGPT account is fine). On auth/model error, surface it — don't silently retry.
- Do NOT pin `-m` or model config (e.g. `model_reasoning_effort`) unless the user asks. Pinning `gpt-5.x-codex` variants 400s on ChatGPT-account auth; config defaults come from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- **Echo the active model at kickoff** so the user can confirm: read the `model` line from `~/.codex/config.toml` (absent = "CLI default"); state it with the resolved tunables. If the user objects, stop before launching the build.
- **Codex has a native image-generation tool** in `codex exec` sessions (ChatGPT-account backed, no API key; verified 2026-07-08 — it saved a generated PNG to disk headless). Specs may therefore include "generate these image assets yourself" steps: name exact file paths, dimensions, and style in the prompt contract.
- Run from the target repo's root (both `exec` and `resume` then need no `-C`; `resume` doesn't support `-C` anyway).

## Tunables (read from args, else default)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `SPEC_FILE` | `PLAN.md` | The frozen spec Codex implements. |
| `MAX_FIX_ROUNDS` | `2` | Fix iterations via resume before Claude takes over and finishes directly. |
| `LOG_FILE` | `PLAN-REVIEW-LOG.md` | Append-only build transcript. If it exists (Act 1/2 ran), append `## Act 3 — Build`; else create it. |
| `PROOF_CMD` | from spec | Exact test/verify command Codex must run as proof. If the spec lacks one, ask the user ONE question to get it before launching. |

Echo resolved values before starting.

## Step 0 — Gates (before any Codex launch)

1. **Spec gate.** `SPEC_FILE` must exist and read as a work order (goal, concrete steps, bounds). No spec → offer `/grill-me-codex` (interview first) or `/codex-review` (have a plan, want it stress-tested) instead. If the user insists on building from a rough idea, write the spec WITH them first — that's design, and design stays with Claude.
2. **Clean-tree gate.** `git status -sb`. Dirty working tree → STOP and ask the user to commit or stash first. Non-negotiable: Codex writes with full access, and a dirty tree means its diff can't be isolated or cleanly reverted.
3. Confirm scope in one line, then go. No round-by-round approvals; the human gate is at the end.

## Step 1 — The build prompt (contract, via temp file)

Never inline-quote the prompt — write it to a temp file. Fill this contract completely; when chained from a grill/review skill, derive it from the plan's sections:

```bash
P=$(mktemp)
cat >"$P" <<'EOF'
GOAL: <one paragraph — what done looks like>
SPEC: Read <SPEC_FILE> at the repo root. It is a frozen, already-reviewed spec.
  Implement it exactly. If a step is impossible as written, implement the
  closest faithful version and report the deviation — do not redesign.
KEY PATHS: <files/dirs Codex will touch or must read first>
CONSTRAINTS: <"don't touch X", style rules, deps that must not change>
NON-GOALS: <explicitly out of scope — from the plan's Out of scope section>
PROOF: Run `<PROOF_CMD>` and include its full output in your report.
OUTPUT: End with a report — files changed (one line each: path + what/why),
  proof output, and any deviations from the spec with reasons.
EOF
```

## Step 2 — Launch Codex (fresh session, capture `thread_id`)

```bash
codex exec --yolo --json -o /tmp/codex-build.txt - <"$P" 2>/dev/null | grep '"type":"thread.started"'
```

- Prompt goes via stdin (`- <"$P"`) — this both avoids quoting bugs AND sidesteps the non-TTY stdin hang (`codex exec` blocks forever waiting on stdin EOF under Claude Code's Bash tool; feeding the file gives immediate EOF).
- Parse `thread_id` from the `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"..."}` line → `THREAD_ID`. Codex's final report lands in `/tmp/codex-build.txt` — read that file; don't parse the JSONL stream for content.
- `2>/dev/null` suppresses cosmetic MCP/auth stderr noise. Confirm success by the report file + a `thread.started` line; neither → failed run (auth/model) — stop and tell the user.
- **Timing:** foreground with `timeout: 600000` on the Bash tool call (default 2-min tool timeout kills real builds). If the spec is clearly >10 min of work (multi-file feature, migration, anything with image generation), launch with `run_in_background: true` instead and read the `-o` file when it exits. Don't kill a quiet background run early — Codex builds are legitimately slow.
- **Heads-up on completion (required):** when a background Codex run finishes, the FIRST line of your next message to the user must be a loud standalone banner — `🔔 CODEX FINISHED — <what> (exit ok/fail) — verifying now` — BEFORE any verification output. The user is not watching tool calls; never let a completed build slide silently into the verify phase.

## Step 3 — Verify (Claude, always, never delegated)

Codex's report is advisory. Verify yourself:

1. `git status -sb` + read the FULL diff (`git diff`). Judge it like a contributor PR: correctness, spec fidelity, style match with surrounding code, nothing touched outside scope.
2. Run `PROOF_CMD` yourself (or the focused tests for the changed area). Codex's pasted output doesn't count as proof.
3. Append to `LOG_FILE` under `## Act 3 — Build`: `### Round <n> — Codex build` + its report summary + `### Claude's verdict` + what passed/failed review.

## Step 4 — Fix loop (same session, bounded)

Problems found → resume the SAME session (Codex keeps its context; cheaper and better than a fresh run). Write the fix list to a temp file (`$P2`), same contract discipline: exact problem, exact file, proof expected.

```bash
# resume has no --yolo and no -C: run from the repo dir and spell the long flag,
# or Codex inherits config.toml's sandbox (possibly read-only) and can't write.
codex exec resume "$THREAD_ID" --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --json \
  -o /tmp/codex-build.txt - <"$P2" 2>/dev/null >/dev/null
```

Re-verify (Step 3) after each round. After `MAX_FIX_ROUNDS` failed rounds: STOP delegating — Claude takes over and finishes the remaining fixes directly. Log the takeover. Ping-ponging trivia through delegation burns more than it saves.

## Step 5 — Human gate (diff sign-off)

Present: 3-bullet summary of what was built, files-changed list, proof-test output (pass/fail, verbatim tail), rounds used, any spec deviations. Ask: *"Codex built it, proof passes, diff reviewed. Commit?"*

- Commit ONLY on yes — and Claude writes the commit, never Codex.
- Rejected → ask what's wrong, route back to Step 4 (or take over directly if fix rounds are spent).

## Hard rules

- Clean tree before launch. Always. No exceptions.
- Claude never skips the diff read. Codex claims are advisory until Claude has read the diff and run the proof.
- Fix loop terminates at `MAX_FIX_ROUNDS` — then Claude takes over. No unbounded delegation ping-pong.
- Commits, pushes, releases, GitHub mutations: Claude-side only, after the human gate. Codex never commits.
- `LOG_FILE` is the deliverable — with Acts 1/2 it tells the whole story: grilled → reviewed → built → verified.

## What NOT to do

- Don't build without a spec — that's designing by delegation, and it fails. Route to `/grill-me-codex` or `/codex-review` first.
- Don't use for ~<20-line single-obvious-change edits — just make the edit.
- Don't pin `-codex` model variants on ChatGPT-account auth — 400s.
- Don't resume with `--last` — capture and use the explicit `THREAD_ID` (parallel sessions make `--last` grab the wrong thread). And ECHO the id into the command visibly before running: `resume` with a missing/garbage id can silently fall back to the most recent session instead of erroring (observed 2026-07-08) — a wrong-target resume looks exactly like a successful one.
- Don't parse the JSONL stream for the report — read the `-o` file.
- Don't let Codex commit, and don't auto-commit yourself — human gate first.
